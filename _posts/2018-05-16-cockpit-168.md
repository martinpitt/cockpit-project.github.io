Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 168.

### Improve checks for root privilege availability

Many actions, like rebooting or joining an IPA domain, can only be performed by
an administrator (aka: `root`).

*[IPA]: identity management system ("Identity, Policy, Audit")
*[aka]: also known as

Cockpit previously checked if the user was a member of the `wheel` (used in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora) or `sudo` (used in Debian and
Ubuntu) groups to enable these actions. Simple group checking was insufficient,
as different group names are used by other operating systems and configurations
or a system might be set up to rely on custom user-based sudo rules.

Cockpit no longer makes assumptions about special groups. Now, Cockpit simply
checks if the user is capable of running commands as `root`.

As a result of this fix, privileged operations now work by default with
[FreeIPA](https://freeipa.org/), as it uses an `admins@domain.name` group.
